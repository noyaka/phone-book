Welcome to my Phone Book project! With this application, you will be able to easily manage all of your contacts in one place. The app displays all of your available contacts in an organized and easy-to-read format, with options to add, edit, and delete contacts as needed.

Adding a new contact is simple: just fill out the necessary fields, including the contact's name, position, address (using an API to ensure accuracy), and telephone number. You can even upload an image to help you easily identify your contact.

Editing and deleting contacts is just as easy. Simply select the contact you wish to modify or remove, and make the necessary changes.

I'm excited to provide this convenient and user-friendly tool for managing your contacts!
